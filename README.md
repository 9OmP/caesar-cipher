This Python script allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It's a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## About the Project

This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python. You can provide a text message, a shift value, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the message. The script handles the rest, providing you with the transformed message.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Caesar Cipher script, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/9OmP/caesar-cipher.git
   
2. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd caesar-cipher

## Usage

### Encrypt a Message

To encrypt a message, run the script with the 'encode' argument, providing the message and shift value:

    ```bash
    python caesar_cipher.py encode
    
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your message and shift value. The encrypted message will be displayed.

### Decrypt a Message
To decrypt a message, run the script with the 'decode' argument, providing the message and shift value:

    ```bash
    python caesar_cipher.py decode
    
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your message and shift value. The decrypted message will be displayed.
